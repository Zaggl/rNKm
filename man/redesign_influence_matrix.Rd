\usage{
redesign_influence_matrix(inf_mat, new_configuration)
}
\arguments{
\item{inf_mat}{Influence matrix}

\item{new_configuration}{New sequence of configuration}

inf_mat <- matrix(c(1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1),4)
rownames(inf_mat) <- colnames(inf_mat) <- c("a","b","c","d")
new_configuration <- c("b","a","d","c")
